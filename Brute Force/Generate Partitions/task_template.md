Given a positive integers $n$, generate all its representations as 
the sum of positive integers (two representations that differ by the 
order of summands are considered the same: 
$1+3+1$ is the same as $1+1+3$ and $3+1+1$).

TODO: Niyaz, please add output format, constraints, sample tests, etc.


<div class="hint">
How would you list all partitions of $n=5$ by hand?
