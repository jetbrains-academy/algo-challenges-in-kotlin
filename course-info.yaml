title: Algorithmic Challenges in Kotlin
language: English
summary: |-
  <p>Prepare for your next technical interview by practicing solving algorithmic challenges in IDE using Kotlin.</p>
  <p>The main learning objectives of this hands-on course are the following.</p> <ul><li><b>Practice applying essential algorithmic techniques.</b> We introduce you to the main algorithmic techniques (brute force, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming). For each topic, you will be solving a number of coding challenges to master the corresponding technique.</li> <li><b>Prepare for your next coding interview.</b> Solve a suite of carefully selected coding challenges that cover the most popular topics from coding interviews.</li> <li><b>Code like a pro.</b> Our workflow will push you to code like a pro, whereas IDEA will boost your productivity: implement a solution using various smart features of IDEA (code inspections, auto-completion, on-the-fly code analysis, and reliable refactoring tools); then ensure that your solution is correct by implementing various tests; then, debug it right in IDEA.</li> <li><b>Practice writing efficient and reliable code.</b> For each problem in this course, your goal is to implement a solution that works in less than one second even on large datasets. When you submit, our automatic grading system checks your solution against a collection of carefully designed test cases that contain both large datasets and various corner cases.</li> <li><b>Practice Kotlin.</b> Implement your solutions in Kotlin, a cross-platform programming language developed by JetBrains.</li></ul>
