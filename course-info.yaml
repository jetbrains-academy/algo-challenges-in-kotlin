title: Algorithmic Challenges in Kotlin
language: English
summary: "Prepare for your next technical interview by practicing solving algorithmic
  challenges in IDE using Kotlin.
  
  The main learning objectives of this hands-on course are the following.
  * **Practice applying essential algorithmic techniques.** We introduce you to the
  main algorithmic techniques (brute force, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic
  programming). For each topic, you will be solving a number of coding challenges to master
  the corresponding technique.
  * **Prepare for your next coding interview.** Solve a suite of carefully selected
  coding challenges that cover the most popular topics from coding interviews.
  * **Code like a pro.** Our workflow will push you to code like a pro, whereas IDEA will
  boost your productivity: implement a solution using various smart features of IDEA
  (code inspections, auto completion, on-the-fly code analysis, and reliable refactoring tools);
  then ensure that your solution is correct by implementing various tests; then, debug it right
  in IDEA.
  * **Practice writing efficient and reliable code.** For each problem in this course, your
  goal is to implement a solution that works in less than one second even on large datasets.
  When you submit, our automatic grading system checks your solution against a collection of
  carefully designed test cases that contain both large datasets and various corner cases.
  * **Practice Kotlin.** Implement your solutions in Kotlin, a cross-platform programming
  language developed by JetBrains."
