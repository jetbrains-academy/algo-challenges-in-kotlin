### Solution

For this trivial problem, we will skip the 
“Designing an algorithm” step and will move right to the pseudocode.

This is how one can turn this pseudocode into Kotlin implementation.

TODO: Niyaz, please add a solution in Kotlin

Copy-n-paste this solution into the file `task.kt`
and press the "Check" button in the right pane. 
The automated grading system will check your solution
against many carefully selected tests to verify that it 
always produces a correct answer and fits into the time 
and memory constraints.

In every programming challenge in this course, your goal is to implement an 
algorithm that produces a correct 
result under one second for any input satisfying 
the given constraints. You do not need to check that the input data satisfies 
the constraints: e.g., for the Sum of Two Digits Problem, you do not need 
to check that the given integers $a$ and $b$ are indeed single digit integers 
(this is guaranteed).
