/*
Niyaz, let's give three methods here â€” with running time, say,
n, n^2, 2^n (each of them may just loop for the corresponding
number of iterations). One can then place three calls
to these methods with n=10^8, n=10^4, and n=30 and report the running
time. We will then invite the learners to fool around with the values
of n to see how the running time changes.
