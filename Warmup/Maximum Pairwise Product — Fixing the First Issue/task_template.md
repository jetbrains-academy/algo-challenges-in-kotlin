In this task, we will fix the first issue with a naive 
solution to the Maximum Pairwise Product. To do this, 
we are going to solve the same problem, but with relaxed constraints:
in this case, the maximum number of elements in the input sequence
is $100$ (rather than $200000$ as in the original problem). While 
fixing the issue, we will also learn how to test your code in IDEA.

By pressing the "Check" button, make sure that the current 
solution does not pass the tests. 
To find a bug in the current implementation,
let's test and debug it. To do this,
...

TODO: Niyaz, please implement initial unit tests and extend 
this section by saying that one needs more tests (in particular, 
those involving large numbers). Lead a learner to a test that 
fails.
