# Welcome!

We are happy to see you here! This interactive course will help
you to prepare for a technical interview and to get used to working
in IDEA, a professional integrated development environment (IDE)
used by millions of professional software engineers all over the world.

The main learning objectives of this hands-on course are the following.
 * **Practice applying essential algorithmic techniques.** We introduce you to the
main algorithmic techniques (brute force, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic
programming). For each topic, you will be solving a number of coding challenges to master 
the corresponding technique.
 * **Prepare for your next coding interview.** Solve a suite of carefully selected
  coding challenges that cover the most popular topics from coding interviews.
 * **Code like a pro.** Our workflow will push you to code like a pro, whereas IDEA will
boost your productivity: implement a solution using various smart features of IDEA 
(code inspections, auto completion, on-the-fly code analysis, and reliable refactoring tools);
then ensure that your solution is correct by implementing various tests; then, debug it right 
in IDEA.
 * **Practice writing efficient and reliable code.** For each problem in this course, your
goal is to implement a solution that works in less than one second even on large datasets.
When you submit, our automatic grading system checks your solution against a collection of 
carefully designed test cases that contain both large datasets and various corner cases.
 * **Practice Kotlin.** Implement your solutions in Kotlin, a cross-platform programming 
language developed by JetBrains.


For each programming challenge, follow the steps below.
 * Read the problem statement. Make sure to check all the constraints — this 
gives you an estimate of the running time of the algorithm you need to design.
 * Design an algorithm. If you need a hint, check out the hints we provide after the problem statement.
We encourage you to first try to come up with an algorithm on your own and only then to uncover the hints.
 * Prove that your algorithm is correct. Ensure that even on large 
datasets it makes no more than $10^9$ basic operations.
 * Implement your algorithm in the file `src/Task.kt`. When doing that, use 
[code completion](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html),
[code inspections](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html), and
various other features of IDEA. 
 * Implement [unit tests](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tdd-with-kotlin.html) 
in the file `test/Tests.kt`.
 * If your implementation does not pass the unit tests, 
[debug](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debug-your-first-kotlin-application.html) it.
 * When your implementation passes all your unit tests, submit it to our grading system by
pressing the Run button. This checks your code against dozens of carefully designed test cases.
For each test case, we check that your code works fast and produces the right result. If your code
fails on some tests, debug it.
 * When you pass all the tests, enjoy the feeling! =)

In the next two problems, we will guide you through this pipeline step by step.

Happy learning!
