# Welcome!

We are happy to see you here! This interactive course will help
you to prepare for a technical interview and to get used to working
in IDEA, a professional integrated development environment (IDE)
used by millions of professional software engineers all over the world.

The main learning objectives of this hands-on course are the following.
 * **Practice applying essential algorithmic techniques.** We introduce you to the
main algorithmic techniques (brute force, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic
programming). For each topic, you will be solving a number of coding challenges to master 
the corresponding technique.
 * **Prepare for your next coding interview.** Solve a suit of carefully selected
  coding challenges that cover the most popular topics from coding interviews.
 * **Code like a pro.** Our workflow will push you to code like a pro, whereas IDEA will
boost your productivity: implement a solution using various smart features of IDEA 
(code inspections, auto completion, on-the-fly code analysis, and reliable refactoring tools);
then ensure that your solution is correct by implementing various tests; then, debug it right 
in IDEA.
 * **Practice writing efficient and reliable code.** For each problem in this course, your
goal is to implement a solution that works in less than one second even on large datasets.
When you submit, our automatic grading system checks your solution against a collection of 
carefully designed testcases that contain both large datasets and various corner cases.
 * **Practice Kotlin.** Implement your solutions in Kotlin, a cross-platform programming 
language by JetBrains.
